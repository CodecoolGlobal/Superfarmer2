## Superfarmer

This application is an implementation of the Superfarmer boardgame. It is implemented in Vanilla Javascript with Python and Flask. 

## Reflection
      
We implemented this practice project in the second module at Codecool, as a means to get familiar with Javascript. We devoted one week to the project in a team of four and delivered a game, which can be played by a group of friends.
